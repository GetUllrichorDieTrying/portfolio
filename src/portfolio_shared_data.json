While there, I found myself increasingly interested in streamlining and automating processes, which lead me to further explore the world of coding. I got out of the Army in September of 2020, and earned my Bachelor of Arts in Law, Economics, and Public Policy from University of Washington in March 2022. Since then I have devoted my time to honing my skills as a Software Developer." ],
